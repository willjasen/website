      <description>This article was originally published on March 19, 2014
After one late night attempting to explain the laws of information entropy, I decided to write an article to sum it up (literally).
We usually hear about entropy in regards to physics, in which it describes how random a physical system is. Newton’s Second Law of Thermodynamics states that a system’s entropy increases over time naturally, meaning that randomness is increased. Information entropy is a little different than physical entropy, though there are related aspects.</description>
