A parched man goes to a vending machine.
“OUT OF ORDER”, the screen blinks after it hungrily eats his change.
That’s when he realized - all of his change was gone.
The man, having attempted to obtain a rental movie, moves on to get a beverage. He finds a local bar, but as soon as he steps up to the bar to order, he realizes yet again that his change was gone.</description>

      <description>rainstash is an Amazon CloudFormation template for automating the setup of Resilio Sync in the Amazon cloud.
rainstash and Amazon CloudFormation is completely free to use, however, Amazon may charge for the use of resources created with rainstash. rainstash uses the following cost-related services: EC2, S3, and data transfer.
Due to technical and security considerations, rainstash by default only accepts encrypted read-only folder keys for the best security. That encrypted data itself resides on an encrypted virtual disk volume, but the instance is meant to be ephimeral.</description>

      <description>This article was originally published on March 19, 2014
After one late night attempting to explain the laws of information entropy, I decided to write an article to sum it up (literally).
We usually hear about entropy in regards to physics, in which it describes how random a physical system is. Newton’s Second Law of Thermodynamics states that a system’s entropy increases over time naturally, meaning that randomness is increased. Information entropy is a little different than physical entropy, though there are related aspects.</description>
