Disillusioned of a bar with no bartender, the man reaches behind the counter and pours himself a shot of whiskey into a highball glass. He raises the glass, tilts his head back, and takes a gulp. The man then turns his attention back and attempts to change the channel on the TV. He clicks it twice and suddenly a picture appears. He gazes into the television set and notices… …a man walks into a bar… The man, having had enough of what he’d seen, turns the knob again and the TV goes back to static.

Being gay is a sexual predisposition - one in which lots of people find themselves attracted to the same sex. Modern society has traditionally shunned homosexuality, sometimes leading to situations which finds people imprisoned or where those who are persecuted end their lives. Such a prime example would be that of Alan Turing, the mastermind of modern computing. Turing devoted his life to creating machines to crack Axis codes during the war, and it was such ended by his own hands after the British government forced him to repress who he was by forcing chemical castration upon him. Because of this for me personally, being gay feels like the ultimate rebellion against a society that was predominantly against it and was pivotal in shaping me as an intellectual and free-thinker. Being told you can’t be one way when you undoubtedly are. There’s a reason they call it “be gay, do crime” - it’s because it was illegal at some point, and still is in some places in the world.

We usually hear about entropy in regards to physics, in which it describes how random a physical system is. Newton’s Second Law of Thermodynamics states that a system’s entropy increases over time naturally, meaning that randomness is increased. Information entropy is a little different than physical entropy, though there are related aspects. Information entropy describes how random the information is, though its entropy does not naturally increase over time. Information entropy was first described by Claude Shannon in 1948. Shannon’s entropy equation is as follows: $$ H(X) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i) \\log_2 p(x_i) $$ where p(x) is the probability of a particular byte and n is the probability space. In the case of computer data, the maximum probability space is n = 256 because there are 256 possible bytes - 0x00 to 0xFF in hex. In practical applications, n can be smaller if a particular byte is not present within the information being calculated. Let’s simplify: what’s the entropy of a fair coin toss? This is calculated as: $$ p(x(heads)) = 50\\% = 0.5, p(x(tails)) = 50\\% = 0.5$$ $$ $$ $$ -[ p(x(heads))] \\log_2 p(x(heads)) + p(x(tails))] \\log_2 p(x(tails)) ] $$ $$ -[ (0.5) \\log_2 0.5 + (0.5) \\log_2 0.5 ] $$ $$ -[ -0.5 + -0.5 ] $$ $$ -[-1] $$ $$ 1 $$ So the answer is 1. What does this mean? In full terms, it means that the amount of information retrieved from a fair coin flip is 1 bit of information per 1 bit of information, and this measurement verifies that the coin’s probability of outcomes is indeed fair. The coin is as random as it can be - there isn’t anything more random than 50/50 with a coin flip. Let’s decrease the randomness of a coin flip by making the coin unfair by increasing the chance of heads to 75%: $$ p(x(heads)) = 75\\% = 0.75, p(x(tails)) = 25\\% = 0.25$$ $$ $$ $$ -[ p(x(heads))] \\log_2 p(x(heads)) + p(x(tails))] \\log_2 p(x(tails)) ] $$ $$ -[ (0.75) \\log_2 0.75 + (0.25) \\log_2 0.25 ] $$ $$ -[ \\approx -0.311 + -0.5 ] $$ $$ -[ \\approx -0.811 ] $$ $$ [ \\approx 0.811 $$ The entropy for this unfair coin toss is around 0.811, meaning that the amount of information retrieved from this unfair coin is around 0.811 bits of information per 1 bit of information. If the probability of heads in increased to 90%, that unfair coin has an even lower entropy than 0.811 bits per bit. Following this trend, as information becomes less random, its entropy becomes smaller relative to the amount of bits per unit of information. A coin with heads on both sides always lands heads and its entropy is exactly zero, meaning that no useful information is conveyed with this kind of coin flip. So calculating the entropy of a fair and unfair coin is interesting, but what practical uses does entropy have, you say? Cryptography algorithms increase entropy of unencrypted data by obscuring it such that without a decryption key, the encrypted information appears more random than the unencrypted information. Compression algorithms decrease the entropy of a file by removing redundant, less random data to lower the file’s size. In fact, from a computational complexity perspective, the amount of entropy of uncompressed data details the mathematical lower bound, which is the best any compression algorithm could ever hope to achieve. In computer and network security, high entropy data may indicate a malicious program trying to mask itself through encryption or obsufcation and low entropy data may indicate a non-compliance of an applied encryption security program, though each scenario depends on the environment and how its used. To calculate the entropy of a file, it must be read byte by byte. Each occurrence of a byte is added to a frequency array to keep track of how often a byte occurs. After the entire file is read, the frequency a","date":"2020-11-27","objectID":"/posts/entropy/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"information entropy","uri":"/posts/entropy/"},{"categories":null,"content":"This is me!
