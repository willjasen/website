A parched man goes to a vending machine.

“OUT OF ORDER”, the screen blinks after it hungrily eats his change.

That’s when he realized - all of his change was gone.

The man, having attempted to obtain a rental movie, moves on to get a beverage. He finds a local bar, but as soon as he steps up to the bar to order, he realizes yet again that his change was gone. The floor of the bar splits with a thunderous crack as everything viciously dissolves away.

There was no order anywhere. The heat death of the universe had lowered entropy everywhere so that all work in the physical sense - and the beautiful and the tragic machinations that were before - was no longer possible.
