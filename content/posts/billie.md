i have a great uncle named BILLIE who, short of 5 days of being in the united states army for a year, was killed in action in italy, within its european theatre of world war 2, at the young age of 19 (april 3, 1944)

i pen this now as an homage to BILLIE, having been met with such an untimely yet incredibly honorable fate, in defense of his family and all peoples back home, to help carry forth a banner that hasn’t been without its own smudges and shame, but was still to stand firmly against the oppressive and oppositional powers seeking out nothing diminutively short of global and total domination for its sick and twisted version of humanity’s place in the universe

these words shall stand as a poor rendition and facsimile of BILLIE’s actions, as a reminder that past histories do not necessarily reflect on future outcomes - sometimes those previous past patterns are fumbled into refuse and damned to reappear, and not solely at the fault of a tempest or an aggressor, but with some small and slight blame to those who are complacent with silence and not willing to rattle a noise

PRIVATE FIRST CLASS BILLIE FAUST HICKS, of the 151st Field Artillery Battalion, 34th Infantry Division, is no longer here to offer proverbs, wisdom, or even a quip, but it is his actions, like so many other brave souls to have pledged and done the same - in their time, and those before them, those after them until now, and those still yet to come - these attributes and attestations afford us all privilege that occasionally lapses our judgement and memory but mustn’t be forgotten and foregone, for it is their corporeal costly contributions and cause that shall not be for naught

honor them not with silence - stand up and speak
