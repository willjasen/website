i have to catch a plane in a few hours but coming back home on monday wonâ€™t be as sweet anymore

sugar was the best and sweetest lilâ€™ kitty that iâ€™ve ever known. she put up such a good face and a great fight since her health started declining. we thought her time had come months ago after her sky blue right eye ruptured but our vet doctor agreed to remove it, with the next day seeing her happier and feeling better than she had been a while. for the last few months, she became much more a lilâ€™ baby than a kitty.

iâ€™m gonna miss her coming up to me and pawing at my leg and meowing to tell me she wanted pets and attention. iâ€™m gonna miss her roaring loudly from another part of the house, telling us to come find her since she canâ€™t hear where we were. iâ€™m gonna miss her leading me along to her when she went to eat, as if she needed a lookout and some protection.

iâ€™d like to think that dad is hugging his kitty again

sugar, the prettiest girl
