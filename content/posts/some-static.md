A man walks into a bar and staggers in puzzled as there is no bartender to be found. The only thing there is an old TV, shining brightly in the darkened establishment. As he slowly approaches the bar counter, he hears a hissing noise and notices static snow on the TV.

Disillusioned of a bar with no bartender, the man reaches behind the counter and pours himself a shot of whiskey into a highball glass. He raises the glass, tilts his head back, and takes a gulp. The man then turns his attention back and attempts to change the channel on the TV. He clicks it twice and suddenly a picture appears. He gazes into the television set and notices...

...a man walks into a bar...

The man, having had enough of what heâ€™d seen, turns the knob again and the TV goes back to static.

As he sat contemplating direction in the dark contrast and bathed in the dimly lit light, the screen read:
