My name is Brandon and this is my website!

I chose the pseudonym 'willjasen' way back in my sophomore year of high school as a stand-in for a stage name. At the time, I was practicing magic and sleight-of-hand and wanted a new, unique name to go by. My middle name is William, so the first name of 'will' was easily chosen. As for the last name of 'jasen', I had recently seen a magician on TV named "Jasen Magic", and something clicked for me and I put the two together - 'willjasen' was then born.

This website is deployed to the InterPlanetary File System, with help from GitHub and Fleek, and design/content management by Hugo.
