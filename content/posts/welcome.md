My name is Brandon and this is my website!

I chose the pseudonym 'willjasen' way back in my sophomore year of high school as a stand-in for a stage name. At the time, I was practicing magic and sleight-of-hand and wanted a new, unique name to go by. My middle name is William, so the first name of 'will' was easily chosen. As for the last name of 'jasen', I had recently seen a magician on TV named "Jasen Magic", and something clicked for me and I put the two together - 'willjasen' was then born. I always like to note that the moniker must be in lowercase and squished together - it's not a proper name!

This website is one of many that I have created and manage but this one is my primary one. This site is deployed to the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.tech), with help from [GitHub](https://github.com/willjasen/website) and [Fleek](https://fleek.co), and design/content management by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
